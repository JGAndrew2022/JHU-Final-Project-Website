			<h1 class="head1">Daytime Daycare</h1>
			<p class="head">Playful Pal's daycare is top notch. We have at least 8000 square feet of space at each and every daycare in Colorado. Our daytime care is designed to keep your dog stress-free, excersised, and well feed (but not overfed). Each dog is given its own 10x10 foot pen. These pens have feeding stations, toys, water, and a bed. If dogs want to socialize, they can go to our large outdoor community pen wherer they can play and hang-out with other dogs. We keep a small sitter-to-dog ratio, meaning that your dog will never need something that they don't have. Our sitters are trained in basic vetrinary and first-aid, and are also masters with almost every breed. If your dog is ona diet you can also bring your own food for your dog to eat. You can also specify the quantity and number of meals per day.<br /> Daytime daycare is $52.00 an hour. This includes food, water, toys, and the dog run. If you need your dog to stay for 6 or more hours, than you can purchase the Full-Day Pack for the discounted price of $300.00.</p>
