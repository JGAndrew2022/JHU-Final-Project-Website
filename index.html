In 2004 we opened "Playful Paws Denver", which is Denver's largest indoor and outdoor canine activity center.

We never rest, and in 2006 we opened "Playful Paws COS South". Almost as big as our Denver location, this became our answer for dogs deprived of a great place to play in Southern Colorado Springs. With indoor and outdoor agility areas. Playful Paws COS serves proudly as a center of canine activity and soon, feline boarding. "Playful Paws COS North" and "Playful Paws Fort Collins" soon followed. Although slightly smaller that COS South and Denver, these facilities were still far from lacking, being some of the largest in their respective cities. Playful Paws continues to work to make their facilities the very best possible. We are even working to introduce feline boarding! In addition, we have accessory stores at all of our locations, so you'll never be out of your dog's favorite items.</article>
